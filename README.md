# Arduino Flex Sensor Bend Angle
This project uses an Arduino board and a flex sensor to measure the angle of the sensor's bend. The angle is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen and can be used in various applications, such as robotics, prosthetics, and gaming.

## Materials
Arduino board (UNO or similar)
Flex sensor
16x2 LCD screen
Potentiometer (10k ohms)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
## Wiring Diagram
(comming soon)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: <strong>git clone https://github.com/alexlux58/Arduino-Flex-Sensor-Bend-Angle.git</strong>
2. Open the Flex_Sensor_Bend_Angle.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer and select the correct board and port in the IDE.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
## Usage
1. Connect the flex sensor to your breadboard and the potentiometer to adjust the contrast of the LCD.
2. Power on your Arduino board and the LCD should display the current bend angle of the flex sensor in degrees.
3. Bend the flex sensor and observe the change in angle displayed on the LCD.
